# DonationPong

A **thing** that uses [hcbthing](https://github.com/Nat3z/hcbthing) to send a webhook message in **discord** for new updates.

# How to use

Use docker plz lol also this is very **tailor made to us at hackbotics**

We don't recommend using this project for your own personal apps/services. Instead, use hcbthing + your own thing to make it work nicely :3
